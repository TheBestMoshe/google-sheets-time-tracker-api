# Google Sheets Time Tracker API

A lightweight, stateless REST API that enables time tracking directly within Google Sheets.

## About the Project

This project provides a simple API to start and stop timers, with all time entries automatically recorded in a Google Sheet. It's designed to be a simple, cost-effective way to track time for client work or personal projects.

The API is built with Bun and TypeScript, and it uses the Google Sheets API v4 for all spreadsheet operations.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Bun
*   A Google Cloud project with the Google Sheets API enabled.
*   A Google Service Account with credentials.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username_/google-sheets-time-tracker-api.git
    ```
2.  Install NPM packages
    ```sh
    bun install
    ```
3.  Create a `.env` file from the `.env.example` and add your Google Service Account key. The key should be Base64 encoded.
    ```
    GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=...
    PORT=3000
    ```
4.  Run the server
    ```sh
    bun run src/index.ts
    ```

## Usage

The API has two main endpoints:

### Start Timer

*   **URL**: `/timer/start`
*   **Method**: `POST`
*   **Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "sheetId": "your-google-sheet-id",
      "description": "Optional task description"
    }
    ```

### Stop Timer

*   **URL**: `/timer/stop`
*   **Method**: `POST`
*   **Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "sheetId": "your-google-sheet-id"
    }
    ```

## Google Sheets Setup

1.  **Create a Google Service Account**: Follow the Google Cloud documentation to create a service account. Download the JSON key file.
2.  **Enable the Google Sheets API**: In your Google Cloud project, make sure the Google Sheets API is enabled.
3.  **Share your Google Sheet**: Create a new Google Sheet and share it with the email address of your service account (you can find this in the JSON key file). Give it "Editor" permissions.
4.  **Set up the `Config` sheet**: Create a worksheet named `Config` in your Google Sheet. This sheet should have two columns: "Setting" and "Value". You can add settings like "Hourly Rate".
5.  **Get the Sheet ID**: The Sheet ID is the long string in the URL of your Google Sheet.
